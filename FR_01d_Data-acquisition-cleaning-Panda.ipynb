Un travail bien fait ! Effectuons une dernière opération de nettoyage. Nous allons modifier le type de nos colonnes. En effet, le type `object` pourrait être gênant lorsque nous effectuerons des opérations numériques. Nous utiliserons la fonction `to_numeric` de pandas ainsi que la méthode `.apply()`, qui nous permet d'appliquer notre fonction le long d'un axe de notre dataframe, dans ce cas à chaque colonne.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"96e0e8aa-f0ac-47f0-904a-a1b9139d8a2b","metadata":{"id":"96e0e8aa-f0ac-47f0-904a-a1b9139d8a2b","outputId":"773b0345-6d95-4003-91f8-20f751534b36"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Country                                   object\n","Year                                       int64\n","GDP [million Euro]                       float64\n","Population                               float64\n","Emissions_GHG [thousand tonnes CO2eq]    float64\n","Emissions_NOx [tonne]                      int64\n","Emissions_PM2.5 [tonne]                    int64\n","Emissions_PM10 [tonne]                     int64\n","Emissions_SOx [tonne]                      int64\n","Emissions_NMVOC [tonne]                    int64\n","Emissions_NH3 [tonne]                      int64\n","Emissions_Pb [tonne]                       int64\n","Emissions_Cd [tonne]                       int64\n","Emissions_Hg [tonne]                       int64\n","Emissions_As [tonne]                       int64\n","Emissions_Ni [tonne]                       int64\n","Emissions_Cr [tonne]                       int64\n","dtype: object"]},"execution_count":46,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["list_hm_obj = ['Emissions_As [tonne]', 'Emissions_Ni [tonne]', 'Emissions_Cr [tonne]']\n","\n","df_clean[list_hm_obj] = df_clean[list_hm_obj].apply(pd.to_numeric)\n","\n","df_clean.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ca650c4-18eb-4425-8181-5a4b41401e57","metadata":{"id":"5ca650c4-18eb-4425-8181-5a4b41401e57"},"source":["Cette fois, nous avons réellement terminé le nettoyage.

Eh bien, ici, c'est parce que je connais notre jeu de données, puisque je l’ai préparé ! En pratique, il faut explorer davantage vos données, par exemple en utilisant l'Analyse Exploratoire des Données, que nous verrons dans une future leçon. Il peut aussi arriver que vous ne réalisiez qu’un problème existe dans les données qu’après avoir commencé à les analyser. Bien que cela puisse être très agaçant, souvenez-vous que **les projets de data science sont un processus itératif**, et qu’il faut souvent faire des allers-retours.\n","\n","Avant de passer à la manipulation des données, nous allons réinitialiser les étiquettes de nos lignes – comme vous pouvez le voir ci-dessus, les numéros de ligne sont ceux de notre jeu de données original. Nous pouvons simplement le faire en utilisant la méthode `.reset_index`.

avons, pour les mêmes polluants que précédemment, leur coût unitaire de dommages.  \n","\n","Les coûts de dommages sont les coûts et dépenses qui sont ou seraient engagés pour prévenir, contrôler ou réduire les dommages environnementaux causés par la pollution.  \n","\n","Nous remarquons que ces coûts varient selon les pays pour les polluants atmosphériques (NO$_x$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$, SO$_x$, NMVOC, NH$_3$).  \n","\n","En effet, ces polluants entraînent une pollution locale : ils sont transportés dans l'air sur une distance relativement courte avant d'être inhalés par les humains et de contaminer le sol, l'eau et les écosystèmes (où ils peuvent être ingérés).  \n","\n","À l'inverse, les gaz à effet de serre (GES) sont responsables du changement climatique, qui est une pollution globale : peu importe où les émissions ont lieu, tous les GES émis contribuent au réchauffement climatique.  \n","\n","Quant aux métaux lourds (Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Ni, Cr), ils provoquent une pollution locale, mais les données disponibles ne concernent que le coût moyen des dommages pour l'Europe.\n","\n","Nous notons que les coûts sont indépendants des années. En effet, toutes les données monétaires (par ex. PIB) sont exprimées en euros constants de 2019.\n","\n","Le **GrDP** est défini comme le PIB moins les coûts externes résultant des activités humaines.  \n","\n","Dans sa version actuelle, l'indicateur inclut uniquement les coûts externes dont les impacts sont connus, mesurés et évalués en termes monétaires, à savoir les GES, les polluants atmosphériques et les métaux lourds.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Fusionner les DataFrames  \n","\n","Pour calculer le **GrDP**, nous devons multiplier les données d'émissions - contenues dans notre DataFrame `df_clean` - par les coûts unitaires - présents dans le DataFrame `df_cost`.  \n","\n","Il sera plus pratique d'effectuer ces opérations sur un seul DataFrame.  \n","\n","Nous devons donc fusionner nos deux DataFrames.\n","\n","Cela semble complexe : non seulement les colonnes diffèrent, mais aussi les lignes puisque les émissions varient chaque année alors que les coûts ne changent pas.  \n","\n","Pas de panique, Pandas vient à notre secours !  \n","\n","Il existe plusieurs méthodes et fonctions pour combiner deux DataFrames :\n","\n","- `.concat()` : combine les DataFrames selon un axe, soit sur les lignes, soit sur les colonnes.\n","- `.join()` : fusionne les données sur une colonne clé ou un index.\n","- `.merge()` : fusionne les données sur des colonnes ou indices communs.\n","\n","Pour mieux comprendre ces méthodes, je vous recommande vivement de lire la [documentation associée](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html).  \n","\n","Vous pouvez également consulter ce [tutoriel de Real Python](https://realpython.com/pandas-merge-join-and-concat/#pandas-concat-combining-data-across-rows-or-columns).\n","\n","---\n","\n","Dans notre cas, nous voulons fusionner nos deux DataFrames de manière à obtenir, pour chaque **observation pays-année**, les variables suivantes :\n","- PIB,\n","- population,\n","- émissions de chaque polluant,\n","- coûts associés à chaque polluant.\n","\n","Nos deux DataFrames ont **une colonne commune** : le **pays**.  \n","\n","De plus, nous voulons **conserver toutes les observations de `df_clean`**, tandis que les coûts d'un pays donné doivent être les mêmes pour chaque année (autrement dit, il faut \"copier\" les informations du DataFrame `df_cost`).  \n","\n","Nous pouvons accomplir cela en utilisant la fonction `.merge()`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Clés et types de fusion\n","\n","Les valeurs des colonnes sur lesquelles nous fusionnons nos DataFrames sont appelées **clés**.  \n","\n","Si vous explorez la documentation de `.merge()`, vous remarquerez différentes options pour gérer les cas où les clés diffèrent (par exemple, si les pays dans `df_clean` et `df_cost` ne sont pas identiques) :\n","\n","- `inner` : ne conserve que les lignes avec des clés communes (intersection).\n","- `outer` : conserve toutes les lignes (union).\n","- `left` : conserve toutes les lignes du **DataFrame de gauche** (le premier) et ignore celles du second s'il y a des clés manquantes.\n","- `right` : conserve toutes les lignes du **DataFrame de droite** (le second) et ignore celles du premier s'il y a des clés manquantes.\n","- `cross` : crée le produit cartésien des lignes des deux DataFrames (toutes les combinaisons possibles de clés).\n","\n","Vous pouvez spécifier la méthode de fusion avec `how`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Application à notre cas\n","\n","Heureusement, dans notre cas, nous **n'avons pas besoin de nous soucier de la méthode**, puisque les pays sont les mêmes dans les deux DataFrames.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Conseil : entraînez-vous !\n","\n","Fusionner des DataFrames nécessite un peu de pratique.  \n","\n","Essayez par vous-même, **vérifiez toujours le résultat**, et recommencez si vous n'obtenez pas ce que vous attendiez !\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"19e0e480-4bbc-4b22-88dd-d63293ea21ca","metadata":{"id":"19e0e480-4bbc-4b22-88dd-d63293ea21ca"},"outputs":[],"source":["df_grdp = pd.merge(df_clean, df_cost, how=\"left\", on=\"Country\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c65eb31-eba4-4bfe-965d-a7aa3cfd7a91","metadata":{"id":"4c65eb31-eba4-4bfe-965d-a7aa3cfd7a91"},"source":["Note that in the code above, we did not need to specify `on` which columns we should merge since the function automatically select all the common columns.

Nous avons des données sur le PIB et sur la population. Pour comparer les pays, il est préférable d'utiliser des indicateurs par habitant. Ainsi, calculons le PIB par habitant. Nous voulons diviser les éléments de la colonne du PIB par les éléments de la colonne de la population. Devons-nous utiliser une technique de compréhension, comme nous l’avons fait avec les listes ? Non ! Avec pandas, lorsque nous voulons diviser une colonne par une autre élément par élément, nous pouvons simplement diviser les deux colonnes.
